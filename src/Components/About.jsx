        <p>
          Hi there, I'm Jordan, on my way to becoming a software engineer,
          blending a decade of hospitality experience with a creative
          background. Managing a high-end cinema venue and undergoing a rigorous
          software engineering bootcamp has uniquely equipped me with insights
          into user experience and digital creativity. My degree in Film and TV
          Production not only speaks to my love for visual storytelling but also
          influences my approach to user-centric software solutions.{" "}
        </p>

          When I step away from coding, I'm all about movies, gaming, 3D
          printing, and exploring new places. My passion for travel complements
          my other hobbies, adding a broader perspective to my work. Whether
          it's experiencing different cultures or experimenting with new
          recipes, these adventures fuel my creativity and inform my approach to
          technology. Take a peek at my portfolio to see how my diverse
          interests and experiences blend into my tech projects, and feel free
          to reach out for a chat or collaboration!
